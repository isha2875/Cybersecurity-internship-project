As AI language models become increasingly integrated into applications and services, their reliance on natural language prompts introduces new security vulnerabilities. One such critical threat is Prompt Injection Attacks, where adversaries manipulate the model's input in a way that causes it to perform unintended actions, leak sensitive information, or bypass safety controls. These attacks exploit the modelâ€™s tendency to interpret and follow instructions embedded within user-supplied or concatenated text.

Prompt injection undermines trust in AI-driven systems, particularly in contexts like chatbots, code generation, and data analysis assistants, where safe and predictable behavior is essential. This repository explores the nature of prompt injection attacks, demonstrates real-world scenarios, and investigates strategies for detection, prevention, and mitigation to enhance the robustness of AI systems.
